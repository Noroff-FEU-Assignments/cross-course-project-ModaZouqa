    <p>Welcome to my first website.</p>
    <h2>Web Security</h2>
    <p id="web-security-question">How would you advise a potential client to secure his/her website from web security attacks? Note: the word count for your answer should not be greater than 250 words</p>
    <p id="web-security-answer">There are practices proven to be efficient against web security attacks that we’ve learned through our studies. These include sanitization of data, secure authorization, usement of a well-known third-party application, continuous deployment/continuous integration (CI/CD) and more. For all of these options there is either a manual - or third-party option. In short: </p>
    
    <p> 1. Sanitization of data revolves around ensuring the data that is being accepted by the system must be in the right format. 
    2. Secure and authorization and authentication provides security in identifying the users and giving them access through a hard-to-crack process
    3. CI/CD integration runs checks for integrating and delivering code to production. If the code does not meet the security checks they will be flagged for a rework.</p>
         
    <p>There are also some steps a front-end developer can take to ensure a safe network security. While the security steps are mostly done by network engineers and backend developers - actions like being connected to a safe network, where you choose to host websites and ensuring that the API you’re consuming has automatic user timeout.</p>
